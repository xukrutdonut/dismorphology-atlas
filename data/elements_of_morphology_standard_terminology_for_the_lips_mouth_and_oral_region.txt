Oligodontia
Comment: The term is not defined here since the finding requires a
radiograph, as is true for anodontia and for the other designation of
tooth agenesis, hypodontia. The terms hypodontia and oligodontia
are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature while on other
occasions hypodontia is used for selective agenesis of six or less
missing teeth while oligodontia is applied when there are more than
six missing teeth. Tooth agenesis or oligodontia/hypodontia can be
mistaken for delayed eruption and again a radiograph is needed for
diagnosis. Absence of teeth may be congenital (tooth agenesis) or
acquired. The incidence of congenital absence of teeth is different
depending on the type and position of the tooth [Gorlin et al.,
2001].

Tooth, Supernumerary
Definition: Extra tooth or teeth (Fig. 52). objective
   Comment: The most frequent supernumerary tooth is a mesio-
dens, which occurs between the two maxillary central incisors.
Often it fails to erupt, but creates a large anterior diastema, and
would not be detected on physical examination (requires X-ray
evaluation). This designation excludes coexistence of primary and
permanent dentition due to delayed loss of the former.
