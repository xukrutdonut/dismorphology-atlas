related fields, such as developmental biology and molecular
genetics, will become more precise. Here we introduce the
anatomy of the craniofacies and define and illustrate the terms
that describe the major characteristics of the cranium and face.                                              Anatomy of the Face and Cranium

   This feature gives the appearance of a tall forehead, and may or
may not include reduction of hair in the temporal areas. This can be
distinguished from male pattern baldness as the hairline is the
superior boundary of the muscular forehead, which can be actively
wrinkled, in contrast to the scalp where no wrinkling can occur. In
addition, texture of the skin of the scalp differs from the texture of
the skin over the forehead.
