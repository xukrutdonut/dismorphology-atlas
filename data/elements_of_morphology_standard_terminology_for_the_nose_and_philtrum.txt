Nose, Large: The term ‘‘large nose’’ has not been defined as it is a
bundled term comprising several distinct features: prominent nose;
wide nasal ridge; prominent nasal tip; and broad nasal base. It
requires an assessment of volume that at present cannot be readily
determined. A prominent nose is often mislabeled as a large nose.

   Comments: The length of the philtrum usually shows a relation
with the length of the nose. The philtrum and nose together occupy
the central face zone; a change of length of one will usually be
accompanied by a compensatory, opposite change in the length of
the other. Therefore a long philtrum often accompanies a Short
nose, but this is not always the case and should be assessed and
coded separately.                                                         FIG. 50. Midline sinus of the philtrum. The lower two panels

   Comments: Usually the nasal columella inserts at the base of the
nose. A Low insertion of the columella leads to shortening of the
philtrum, but these should be coded separately. Using the insertion
of the columella as the upper limit of the philtrum would then lead
to a false shortening. An Everted upper lip often leads to the
subjective appearance of a short philtrum but these should be
coded separately.
