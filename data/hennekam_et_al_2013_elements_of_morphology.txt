   The various findings are listed alphabetically. If a feature is
indicated in bold-italics, the feature is listed and a definition is
available. The terms are alphabetized based on the physical feature,
not the modifier.
   Investigating the genitalia should always be performed with the
observed person in a relaxed position. The presence of a nurse or
parent is advisable. Small children are best investigated in their parent’s
lap. The testes can be palpated in a supine position but it may be useful
to ask the observed person to squat as this allows better palpation.
Repeat genital examinations may be embarrassing for the subject [Lee
et al., 2006] and should be performed only when indicated.

Bladder, Exstrophy
Definition: Eversion of the posterior bladder wall through the
congenitally absent lower anterior abdominal wall and anterior
bladder wall (Fig. 5). objective
   Comments: Exstrophy of the bladder can be associated with
Epispadias and Bifid penis or in females with Bifid clitoris, a bifid
uterus, and a Septated vagina, each of which should be coded
separately.

Chordee
Definition: Ventral, lateral, or ventrolateral bowing of the shaft and
glans penis of more than 30 degrees (Fig. 6). objective
   Comments: The degree of variation of penis curvature is a
continuum, but traditionally 30 degrees is considered the threshold
for surgical intervention on chordee [Bologna et al., 1999]. Bowing
usually becomes more obvious in an erect penis, but is frequently
also palpable when stretching a flaccid penis. Chordee can be
congenital or acquired; if the former, it can be associated with
Webbed Penis or Hypospadias, which should be coded separately.


Cryptorchidism
Definition: Testis in inguinal canal. objective
   Comments: The gonad is mobile and can be retracted superiorly
by the cremaster muscle reflex stimulated, for instance, by cold or
touch. A retracted testis is not cryptorchidism. An abdominal testis
cannot be distinguished by physical examination from an (Appar-
ently) absent testis and requires radiological (or, rarely, surgical)
procedures for assessment.                                                        FIG. 5. Bladder exstrophia. Courtesy of Dr. Anne-Karoline Ebert.

Hypospadias

objective
   Comments: Hypospadias is categorized in several ways, the most
classical one being first degree (urethral opening on the ventral
glans), second degree (urethral opening on the ventral shaft), and
third degree (urethral opening on the perineum). Second degree
hypospadias is frequently accompanied by Chordee of the penis,
which should be coded separately. The widely used Duckett classi-
fication [Baskin and Duckett, 1996] categorizes hypospadias into
glandular, coronal, distal penile shaft (or “anterior”) subgroup,
mid-shaft (or “middle”) subgroup, or proximal penile shaft, peno-
scrotal, and perineal (or “posterior”) subgroup. A surgically ori-
ented categorization to classify hypospadias has been developed
based on the position of the division of the corpus spongiosum
