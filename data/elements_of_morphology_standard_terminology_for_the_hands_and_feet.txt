such measurements. Clubbed fingers are often described as resem-
bling the end of drumsticks. The affected digits should be specified
as described in the introductory comments. If no subtype identifier
is specified, it is assumed that all digits are involved. Although
increased soft tissue is the sole or major component of clubbing,
some cases may be associated with bone spurs or modest over-
growth of the distal phalanx. As this is not relevant to the clinical
(non-radiographic) assessment of clubbing, it is not specified in the
definition of this term.

not used for the first digit, see Broad thumbs. When a thumb and
one or more fingers are affected, it may be more economical to
specify ‘‘Broad fingers, F1–5’’ instead of separately specifying

   Comment: This is an acknowledged bundled term as the defini-
tion in most anthropometric sources assumes that the other fingers
are all as relatively short as is the middle finger. As the determination
of the proportionality of the other four digits is clearly subjective,
the term must be regarded as subjective. The Bell classification of
brachydactyly (summarized in Temtamy and McKusick [1969]) is a
complex assessment of hand patterning—that usage of the word
‘‘brachydactyly’’ is independent of the use here. When
‘‘Brachydactyly type x’’ is used, this refers to the Bell classification
patterns. When Brachydactyly of the hand is used, it solely refers to
reduced length of the specified digits. ‘‘Short hand’’ should not be
used as it is a bundled definition of Short fingers and Short palm. If

Foot, Split
Definition: Longitudinal deficiency of a digital ray of the foot
except rays 1 or 5 (Fig. 32). subjective
    Comment: The threshold for this deficiency should be that all of
the phalanges in the ray are absent and at least part of the metatarsal.
If just the phalanges that are missing, this should be coded as Absent
toe. The absence of a central ray or rays frequently yields a cleft
appearance of the foot. This term is preferred to ‘‘ectrodactyly of the
foot’’ as this has been used (more appropriately) for various forms
of phalangeal hypoplasia or amputation. ‘‘Lobster claw deformity’’
is neither descriptive nor acceptable. There is wide variation in the
affected feet, but the common factor is the absent central ray,
justifying Split foot as a clinical designation.

Hallux, Absent

allow the distinction of loss of a preaxial digit (thumb or great toe)         FIG. 34. Broad hallux, right. See also Figure 60B.

radiograph [see Allanson et al., 2009b this issue, for a discussion of
the use of radiographs], the examiner grasps two adjacent meta-
carpals, each with a thumb and index finger on the dorsum and
palmar aspect of the hand and attempts to independently maneuver
the metacarpals. If they cannot be independently manipulated,
osseous syndactyly is present [Biesecker, 2007]. Consensus could
not be reached on the utility of the bundled term of Mesoaxial
polydactyly, so it is specified in the terminology for the time being.
It is arguably superior to describe the two separate terms (e.g.,
Osseous syndactyly of F3,4 (metacarpal) and Postaxial polydactyly
of the hand, type A). The term ‘‘insertional polydactyly’’ may be less
desirable because the word ‘‘insertion’’ implies mechanism, which
is unlikely to be an insertion. The utility of this term should be           FIG. 59. Mirror image polydactyly, right foot. Note that this

Thenar Eminence, Small
Definition: Reduced palmar soft tissue mass surrounding the base
of the thumb (Fig. 63). subjective
   Comment: The reduced soft tissue is typically abductor pollicis
brevis and flexor pollicis brevis muscle bulk. Detection of this
abnormality entails clinical judgment, especially in mild cases. The
bulk of the muscle mass around the base of the thumb is diminished,
and there may be a mild concavity over the volar aspect of the first
metacarpal. When the deficiency is unilateral, comparison between
the two hands will point up the often-subtle change in contour of
the thenar muscles. If the degree of involvement is severe, the palm
may taper in width proximally.

   Comment: The technique for the thumb placement index is
described in detail [Malina et al., 1973; Hall et al., 2007]. Briefly, the
thumb placement index is the distance from the proximal crease of
the index finger to the angle of the first interdigital space divided by
the distance from the proximal crease of the index finger to the wrist
flexion crease at the base of the thumb. This term should not be used
with Preaxial polydactyly.

   Comment: The use of the word ‘‘fused’’ is not meant to imply
that pathogenetically these nails were separate and merged. This is
distinct from a split or cleaved nail, where the two parts of the nails
share the same radius of curvature. The involved digits should be
specified. It may be associated with underlying syndactylous digits,
but these are coded separately.
