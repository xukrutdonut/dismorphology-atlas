the right place to initiate the process of definition of phenotypic
variations; however, completion of this entire list of physical fea-
tures was a daunting task. Therefore, the group chose to begin the
project by narrowing the choice of terms to the craniofacial region
and the hands and feet. The terms for these areas of the body were
considered to be the most commonly used in the field to describe
patients and delineate syndromes. This narrowed the list to just over
400 features in the LDDB.
   Starting with this list, the 34 members were divided into the six
working subgroups (see Table I in Allanson et al. [2009a]), which in-
cluded the head and face; periorbital region; ear, nose, and philtrum;
lips and mouth; and hands and feet. The group leaders then assigned
about 10–15 features to each member of their respective subgroup,
who were charged with defining each feature on their list and propos-
ing a working definition for the entire group. The working group
met initially in September 2005 at the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) and again in November 2006 in Rome, Italy. The process
of developing the consensus definitions was time consuming and
stringent; it involved the drafting of the assigned definitions, atten-
dance at the two meetings, hundreds of E-mails, perusal of over
400 figures, 2 years of revisions of the proposed definitions, and five
Web-based conference calls by the four committee chairs who are
authors of this article. The participants of each of the groups had
input on all of the definitions in the other areas of the body. The
committee chairs finalized the definitions and proposed them for
review and discussion as the process proceeded to its 4-year con-
clusion and submission of the articles to the American Journal of          Figure 2. This photograph provides an example of a defined variation
