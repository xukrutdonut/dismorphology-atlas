Enamel. Hard acellular structure covering tooth crown. Enamel is the
most mineralized material (98%) in the human body, secreted by amelo-
blasts. Ameloblasts disappear as the tooth erupts within the oral cavity.
Enamel is able to neither regenerate nor repair. Enamel is translucent and
appears to have a color that varies from white to light yellow depending
of the color of the dentin. The surface is smooth and glossy (Figure 3).


Dentin. Dentin is a mineralized connective tissue forming the dental
crown and root. Dentin is a vital tissue, less mineralized than enamel,
and has the capacity to repair. Odontoblasts are the dentin forming
cells and are located in the dental pulp periphery just below dentin.
Odontoblasts extend a long cytoplasmic process radially from the pulp
to the dentino-enamel and dentino-cemental junctions inside canalic-
uli; these are called dentin tubuli (Figure 3).


Dental pulp. Soft connective tissue occupying the inner portion of the
tooth, both in the crown (pulp chambers) and the root canals covered         F I G U R E 5 Normal mamelons in a mandibular incisor [Color figure

The terms oligodontia and hypodontia have been used interchangeably
in literature, but these define two different clinical entities if consider-
ing the number of missing teeth. Maxillary lateral incisor and second
premolar are more commonly part of oligodontia (Fournier et al.,
2018), maxillary second premolars, mandibular incisor, and maxillary
and mandibular first premolars, and second molars are less frequently
absent. Canines, maxillary central incisor, and first molars are the more
conserved teeth. Agenesis of a permanent tooth is often associated
with persistence of the deciduous predecessor and may be associated
with other dental anomalies such as delayed eruption, infraocclusion of
deciduous molars (if premolars are involved), microdontia, ectopic
teeth, short roots, taurodontism, tooth rotation, or enamel hypo-
calcification. These signs should be assessed and coded separately.
Isolated oligodontia affects 0.1% of the population (Polder et al.,
2004). The clinical absence of a tooth due to a disturbed eruption
should not be termed teeth agenesis but a missing tooth.

Mesiodens is the most common supernumerary tooth. Typically, they
are small. They are usually conical in shape but may have heteroge-
neous forms. Mesiodens may remain unerupted and cause failure of a
permanent incisor to erupt. Mesiodens may develop in an inverted
position (flipped 180 ).

Age-related physiological sequential eruption should be taken into
account during evaluation. The type and the location of the additional
tooth/teeth should be added to the description. Supernumerary teeth
are uncommon (in 0.21% of deciduous dentitions and in 0.9% of perma-
nent dentitions) (Lagana et al., 2017), and often abnormal positioning of
a normal number of teeth is wrongly classified as supernumerary teeth.
Supernumerary teeth are most frequent in the upper maxilla, and typi-
cally, a single additional tooth is present. We discourage the use of
distodens, distomolars (an extra fourth molar posterior to the third
molar), paramolars (supernumerary tooth in the molar region) but rather
to mention the presence of the supernumerary tooth mesial to or distal      F I G U R E 1 2 Enamel pearls [Color figure can be viewed at

Standard references for means and standard deviations by gender are
available (Figure 4) (Black, 1890; Lavelle, 1972). Microdontia may
affect a single tooth or the entire dentition, which is indicated as local-
ized or generalized microdontia. The most common tooth involved is
the lateral incisor. Microdontia goes often along with hypodontia and
oligodontia, which should then be assessed and scored separately.
Microdontia is typically genetically determined but environmental fac-
tors may be also implicated (Jeong, Kim, Song, Sung, & Kim, 2015).
